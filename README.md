Bank Campaign Prediction with Random Forest

In this project i use bank-additional-full.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahistapatel96/bankadditionalfullcsv) data. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Dataset contained input and output variable.
The attribute of the dataset includes:
- Demographic information
- Related with the last contact of the current campaign
- Social economic context
- Other attributes

I try to predict the client will subscribe the campaign or not with the data use Random Forest. Because this dataset doesn't have primary key so i just check the accuracy of several algoritm and decided to use random forest for best prediction. I dont do a final test with the data because there is no primary key.
